Projects
========
My projects can be viewed at [github](https://github.com/byllgrim).

I regret using github, but the alternative is either hosting it myself or
finding some site i can beg to host for me.

Philosophy
==========
I am a big fan of [suckless.org](http://suckless.org/philosophy).
Whatever they say, I most likely agree.
