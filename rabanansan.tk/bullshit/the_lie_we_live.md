The Lie We Live
===============
...is a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/ipe6CMvW0Dg) about society.
I agree with the premisses laid out in the first 4 minutes,
but his implied conclusion seems baseless.

There is victory music playing in the background and he uses catchy rhetorics.
Preferably, I'd like my arguments logical, not *inspiring*.

The following is a review of most of the claims in the video.

Hopefully I wasn't at an all time low in cognitive level when writing this.
I'd feel a bit embarrassed if I accidentaly wrote bullcrap.

You could be anywhere
---------------------
> Instead you sit alone before a screen

Before a screen is a wonderfull place to be and is exactly where I wanna be.
Where else could I be programming and learning about computers?

There is tonnes of valuable information to assimilate on the internet.
By sitting before a screen I learn so much.
One could also learn by discussing irl or by writing on paper.
Both of which I also do, so the computer has not "taken over".
Also, I exercise.

And I am not alone.
The entire last month was spent practically living in bed with my gf.

If the author of the video would claim that this behaviour is "virtueless"
or something reasonably synonymous, I hope to see arguments in the remainder
of the video.

Each day we live the same day
-----------------------------
> We wake up in the same room

It's called "having a home" and it's not so bad.

> follow the same path

Paths are *spiritually* sounding.
Everything spiritual means loving and human and everything nice, right?
And also
[everything natural is good](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature).

> live the same day as yesterday

I certainly don't.
Allthough, tragically, many people do.

This seems to be a critique of capitalism or corporatism, and
if it is, i agree with the author.

At one time, each day was a new adventure
-----------------------------------------
When we were kids, we had joyfull interrest in the world,
which along the way diminishes. Agreed.

> Along the way, something change.

Indeed, educational systems [can be a bitch](https://youtu.be/iG9CE55wbtY).
I certainly had many problems with it.

Is this what it means to be free?
---------------------------------
> Before, our days were timeless.
> Now, our days are scheduled.

If this is critique of capitalism, corporatism, social norms or something
similar, I agree once again.

> But are we really free?

I don't feel free.
I feel obliged, forced and confined.

No land to build a home
-----------------------
> Food, water, land...
> The very elements we need to survive are owned by corporations

[Annoyingly so](https://www.yahoo.com/news/eight-men-own-half-worlds-wealth-oxfam-001214017.html).

Thankfully, someone is trying to
[do something about that](http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set)

> You'll be locked away

Annoyingly so...
Too many of *our* rules seem undue.

> So we obey their rules

Implications of a hidden order ruling the world needs some evidence.
I'm sorry, websites with artistic spiritual drawings are not arguments.

We discover the world through a textbook
----------------------------------------
True.
I am also under the impression that it could be beneficial if people
did some more "thinking outside the box".
There is only so much you can achieve by regurgitating dogma.

> Like subjects in a lab.
> Raised not to make a difference.

This implies knowledge of unknown peoples intentions.

> So we work and work

As if working is intrincically bad.

> No time to live the life we work for

Agreed, I also think bosses and CEOs steal from laborers.
Is this video turning into communist propaganda?

A day comes when we are too old to do our jobs
----------------------------------------------
> It is here we are left to die.
> Our children take our place in the game

Unnecessary rhetorics meant to capture the pathos of the audience.

I care very little for this bullshit.

To us, our path is unique
-------------------------
More paths, ey?

> Together we are nothing more than fuel.
> The fuel that powers the elite.

More guessing of unknown peoples intentions,
and claims about the effect of claimed actions related to such intentions.

This breaks every principle of any
[epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) theory ever,
e.g. [the scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).

> The elite who hide behind the logos of corporations

Enough with the rhetorics!

This point has now been brought up about three times or so,
and I suspect it will be repeated even more!
I still think capitalism/corporatism sucks.

This is their world
-------------------
What does this even mean?

Not to invoke an argument over semantics, property or logical fallacies...

> Their most valuable resources are us

It's true that our purchasing choices and so on contribute to inequality,
but this is the claim about unknown peoples intentions **AGAIN**!

Note that the background music is now cranked up to emotion level **epic**.

> We build their cities, run their machines, fight their fights

True, even though this is more communist propaganda,
[I agree](http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/).

Money isn't what drives them.
-----------------------------
I can't even [understand money](https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0).

> Money is the tool they use to control us

This, *again* makes some serious claims with LARGE implications.
Proof is very welcome.

> Worthless pieces of paper we depend on

*not an argument*, but again, I agree with your anti-capitalist tendencies.
This is becoming repetitive...

Trees are dead
--------------
Factories, poison, climate change, etc...

I voted for the green party, don't have a drivers license and rarely
buy anything.

Animals are slaughtered
-----------------------
The whole deal with moral nihilism vs moral relativism vs moral skepticism, etc
is a mess.
There exist possible subsets of each of those.
Some of which might even be compatible.

Anyway, I'm far from convinced that all life is sacred.

END OF RANT
-----------
I must end the rant here.
A slight mismatch of terminology put me off course.
Now it's time to investigate differences between nihilism, relativism et al.

Also, it's almost bedtime and I'm sick of this preaching
gospel dogma propaganda video.
