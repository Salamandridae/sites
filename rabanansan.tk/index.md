==========
This is the web page of rabanansanshikimuri.

Take a look around.

Primary purpose
===============
The webpage is intended as a place to put lecture notes from uni.
I will try to revise and annotate them before and after publishing.

Previously, my approach was to use LaTeX and PDF, but I wish to compare that
method with writing a webpage markdown.

Future
------
I might add more stuff about programming, politics, etc.
