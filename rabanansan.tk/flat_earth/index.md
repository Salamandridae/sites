Eureka tower experiment
=======================
A [youtube video](https://youtu.be/_ewCQnJSEkM) video tapes various
landmarks around Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia.

From the distance to the landmark, the height of the landmarks,
and earths curvature, one would expect far away objects to eventually
drop beyond the horizont.
The video claims that the calculated drop is not observed in reality,
thereby showing the earth is flat.

I wish to reproduce the math and see if the results match.
It is also a good idea to check if the map distances are correct,
and investigate what role optics play in this appearance.

Claimed premises
----------------
    Earth radius = 3958.75 miles
    Curvature drop = Miles squared X 0.67 = Feet in drop

The White Lighthouse Of Queenschliff
====================================
Claimed facts
-------------
    Landmark elevation = 28.6 metres = 93.83 feet
    Landmark height = 22.2 metres
    Observation point = Portsea pier
    Observation elevation = a few feet above sea level
    Distance to landmark = 4.29 miles

    Drop = 4.29 X 4.29 X 0.67 = 12.33 feet

Mud Islands of Port Phillip Bay
===============================
Claimed facts
-------------
    Landmark elevation = 4 meters = 13.12 feet
    Landmark height = 
    Observation point = Tootgarook Beach
    Observation elevation = 2 feet above sea level
    Distance to landmark = 7.71 miles

    Drop = 7.71 X 7.71 X 0.67 = 39.82 feet

The math:

    2feet = 0.00041 miles
    0.00041*7926 = 3.24^0.5 = 1.8
    7.7miles - 1.8miles = 5.9miles
    5.9^2*8 = 278.48/12 = 23.2feet
    23.2feet = 7m

Highest point of island would be 3m below horizon.

The Eureka Tower
================
Claimed facts
-------------
    Landmark elevation = 3 metres
    Landmark height = 297.3 metres
    Landmark total = 300 metres = 984.25 feet
    Observation point = Portsea pier
    Observation elevation = few feet above fea level
    Distance to landmark = 36.85 miles

    Drop = 36.85 X 36.85 X 0.67 = 909.8 feet

The math:

    few feet <= 6 feet
    6 feet = 0.00125 miles * 7926 = 9.9075
    9.9^0.5 = 3.14
    36.85-3.14 = 33.71^2 = 1136.36*8 = 9090.91
    9090.91/12 = 757.57 feet = 229.5 metres

Only last 70m of tower would be visible.
At least 80m of miss.curvature.
