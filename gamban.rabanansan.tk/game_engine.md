Game engine
===========
There are two options:

 1. Roll our own
 2. Use a premade one

Rabnis opinion
--------------
I, rabni, am mostly for rolling our own, as that is my main interest in
this project.

Altough, whichever we choose, I prefer it to be FLOSS and run on linux.
Preferably it shouldn't even run on anything but unix, but that is unrealistic.

DIY engine
==========
Graphics, input, audio, etc is difficult.
For this, we should __carefully__ hand pick a few *good* libraries with
as few dependencies as possible.

We should invest time into some research on game loop and various techniques
in game engine design and choose the best of the best options.

It __must__ be written in C, or I will cry like a baby.

It __must__ be simple!
KISS or the bugs will bite and, once more, I will cry.

It should run on at least linux and MS-Windows™©.

Premade engine
==============
There exist some cool, open sores or linux engines:

 - IdTech, with doom and wolfenstein, releases their engines as GPL.
 - Openmw has a game engine, allthough it is highly genre specific.
 - Unreal has support for linux.
 - Valves Source engine has support for linux.
 - There are more, I just havent bother looking.
